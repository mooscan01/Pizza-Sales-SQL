## 🍕 Pizza Sales Analysis – SQL Project

This repository contains the dataset for a SQL-based project aimed at analyzing pizza sales data. The purpose of this project is to perform data exploration and generate business insights using SQL queries.

---

### 📦 Dataset Description

The dataset is composed of four CSV files that simulate a pizza restaurant's order and menu information:

* **orders.csv**: Contains order IDs and order timestamps.
* **order\_details.csv**: Links orders with the quantity and type of pizzas.
* **pizzas.csv**: Contains details about each pizza including size and price.
* **pizza\_types.csv**: Contains information about pizza names, categories, and ingredients.

### 🎯 Objectives (Planned SQL Tasks)

* Analyze total sales and revenue.
* Identify best-selling pizza types and sizes.
* Find peak sales hours and days.
* Calculate average order value.
* Analyze sales by category (Classic, Veggie, Chicken, etc.).

---

### 🧠 Skills to be Applied

* SQL Joins (INNER JOIN, LEFT JOIN)
* Aggregations (`SUM`, `COUNT`, `AVG`)
* Date and time functions
* Subqueries and CTEs
* Filtering and grouping

---

### 🔧 Tools Used

* SQL (MySQL / PostgreSQL / SQLite)
* Excel (for basic inspection)
* \[Optional] Power BI or Tableau (for visualization after SQL)

---

### 🚀 How to Start

1. Load the `.csv` files into your SQL environment (e.g., MySQL or PostgreSQL).
2. Create appropriate tables and relationships.
3. Run SQL queries for analysis based on business questions.
4. \[Optional] Visualize the results using a BI tool.
